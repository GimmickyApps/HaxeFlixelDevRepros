# ScaleHuh
Trying to figure out scaling trouble in HaxeFlixel.

My ultimate goal is to have manual control over layout so that I can dynamically support desktop (with whatever size/shape window), tablet, and phone (in either orientation) resolutions in a way that makes use of every available pixel (i.e., no black bars at the side, and I control the scaling of multiple custom cameras.)
