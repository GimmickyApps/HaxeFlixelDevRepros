# ScaleHuh, now HaxeFlixelDevRepros
Trying to figure out scaling trouble in HaxeFlixel, and other things now that that is figured out.

## Scaling

My ultimate goal is to have manual control over layout so that I can dynamically support desktop (with whatever size/shape window), tablet, and phone (in either orientation) resolutions in a way that makes use of every available pixel (i.e., no black bars at the side, and I control the scaling of multiple custom cameras.)
